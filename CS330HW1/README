General:
CS330HW1 file contains all three questions that were asked in the hw description. The code is contained in CS330HW1_Q1. For the UML diagram I exported it as a picture(.svg) as well as the tiny UML file type(.tsm). Lastly, Q3 is in CS330HW_1_Q3, which is a word document. 

Assumptions:
I assumed that it was suppose to be structured like the GuitarHero in class assignment. So I didn't ask the user for any input. When the order or weapon needs to change I just call the corresponding function and a new order or weapon in. For pickup_newweapon, I followed the slides and made a chooseWeapon function for pickup_newweapon to call. 


Compile:
cd into CS330HW1_Q1
then use: javac *.java
and then: java GameDriver
